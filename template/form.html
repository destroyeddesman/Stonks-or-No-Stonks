        <p class="introduction">
            There’s a common proverb in economics that goes: “There’s no such thing as bad publicity”.
        </p>
		<p class="explanation">
			While there are many things that influence the stock market, we have decided to stay true to this publicity proverb and predict the future stock values of companies based on how popular the stocks are. Without further ado, we present possibly the only stock market prediction program that you will ever need to base your future stock decisions off of: Stonk or no Stonk!
		<br>
		<br>
			How we did it: We took google trend data and past stock data and cross referenced the two to predict the direction of the future stock to see if it goes up or down. If you want to know the rest of our secrets, we gladly accept donations. (Bitcoin only please)
